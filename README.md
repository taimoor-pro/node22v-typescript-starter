## âš’ How to Install

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/taimoor-pro/node22v-typescript-starter.git
$ cd node22v-typescript-starter
$ pnpm install
```

## Configuration

Before starting the project, make sure to set up your database credentials in the `.env.development.local` file. This file is used for local development and should not be committed to version control. Here's an example of how the `.env.development.local` file should be structured:

### Database Configuration

- **DB_HOST=** 127.0.0.1
